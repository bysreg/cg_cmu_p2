Describe the required features you have implemented, and which you have not.
if you have missing features, be sure to explain how much you accomplished.
You should detail anything you think we need to know to understand your code.

I implemented : 
- reflection shader
- loop subdivision algorithm 
- fast subdivision (6th iteration of stegosaurus in under 2 seconds)
